    <p><b><a href="https://support.documoto.com/hc/en-us/categories/33608183765651-3D-Content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Update! 3D Part Thumbnails Launch:</a></b></p>
    <li>The new 3D thumbnail feature in Documoto provides an interactive CAD model preview, enhancing the understanding of product components for end users. Content Administrators can easily import, preview, and manage 3D CAD models in the Admin Center, while end users can explore these dynamic models through rotation, slicing, and view options in the Library. This feature enriches the user experience by offering an intuitive, detailed view of parts. (Note: This feature is an add-on and may not be enabled for your tenant.)</li>
    
    <p><b>Library Updates:</b></p>
    <li><b>Comments User Experience on Item Details Page:</b> The Comments Item Details UX in the Library has been improved by reducing the real estate of the Add Comment area. The comment box is now initially in an inactive state with instruction text, expanding when clicked. Additionally, the add comment input box has been moved to the bottom of the comments list, ensuring users can view already posted comments first.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in filters on the search results page, where results would not return at all if a user was typing quickly in the filter field. (enterprise-4075)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the type-ahead functionality for filters and search results, ensuring that suggestions continue to display and update as users type, rather than stopping after encountering certain characters (like a dash or underscore). (enterprise-4115)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented users with 'Edit All' user group privileges from editing comments. Users with appropriate permissions can now add, edit, and delete comments as expected.</li>
    
    <p><b>Storefront Updates:</b></p>
    <li><b>NEW Order Comments Feature:</b> Order Comments functionality has been introduced for Order Management. Users with appropriate privileges can now add comments when changing order status, providing important update information to order submitters. Comments are visible in the order history and included in status change emails from Documoto.</li>
    <li><b>NEW Option to Return an Order to “Open” Status:</b> Order Management Approvers and Viewers now have the option to return an order to “Open” status, allowing the user that submitted the order to adjust their order as needed and resubmit. This feature is not supported for customers with cart submission integrations to their ERP, eCommerce, or other systems.</li>
    <li><b>Quick Add from Static Content for SendItems Integrations:</b> The Quick Add to Cart feature has been extended to support SendItems integrations. Users in tenants with SendItems integration can now use Quick Add to Cart from static content, generating a SendItems event to add parts to the external cart.</li>
    <li>Introduced a change to Admin Center > Storefront > Order/Quote Fields to disable the ‘Delete’ icon when an order form field cannot be deleted. (enterprise-3405)</li>
    <li>A bug has been fixed where users with Organization Admin privileges but without Order Management privileges could edit their own order statuses. This issue has been resolved to ensure that only users with appropriate Order Management privileges (Viewer or Approver) can edit order statuses. (enterprise-124)</li>
    
    <p><b>Admin Center Updates:</b></p>
    <li> The Upload Progress feature has been added to Tenant Print Settings, providing consistency with Media Print Settings. Users will now see progress bars when uploading files under Cover & Stitch Pages in the Admin Content Print Settings Layout. (enterprise-4054)</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where User Group Permissions for 'Disable Book Printing' were incorrectly disabling printing/exporting for all content. Users can now export/print chapters and parts pages when book printing is disabled. (enterprise-4131)</li>
    <li>Resolved a problem where thumbnails were being converted to public attachments when replaced or deleted. Thumbnails are now properly disassociated without being moved to attachments. (enterprise-1510, 356, 653)</li>
    <li>A bug in the Admin Page Editor has been resolved, allowing content files from 'Documoto Search' to successfully replace existing files for static pages. (enterprise-4105)</li>
    
    <p><b>Widget Updates:</b></p>
    <li><b>Quick Add from Static Content for Widgets:</b> Quick Add functionality has been extended to non-interactive content in the “Library” type Widget, allowing users to add parts to the cart from static media and pages. This improves workflow efficiency by eliminating the need to manually note part numbers for later addition.</li>
    <li>Addressed an issue that caused intermittent 'No Book Found' errors in Widgets search results. The search functionality has been stabilized to consistently return accurate results. (enterprise-4039)</li>
    <li>Corrected a display issue in the Widget breadcrumb on tablet view (768px) where long titles were causing the search breadcrumb to be cut off. (enterprise-4044)</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the Page Widget where the Page Title was not displaying on screens with a resolution of 640 pixels or less. (enterprise-4064)</li>
    <li>Addressed an issue with the Book Widget's Related Content display in Item Details. The Related Content box was previously inconsistent in its appearance. This fix ensures a more reliable and consistent display of related content. (enterprise-4070)</li>
<br>

    <p><b><a href="https://bit.ly/3U3RIZW" target="_blak" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0.3067</a> (2024-10-09)</b></p>
    <p><b>Major Update! Item Details GA:</b></p>

    <p><b>Library Updates</b></p>
      <li><b>Quick Add Feature:</b> Users can now add parts to the cart directly from non-interactive content using the new ‘Quick Add’ button with a shopping cart icon, allowing for seamless part search and addition. Admins can configure this setting via Admin Center > Content > Page (or) Media editor on a per Page/per Media basis. (enterprise-4037)</li>
      <li><b>Error Toasts:</b> The error toast notification display duration in the Library has been increased from 4 to 10 seconds, and an “X” button has been added to close the toast. (enterprise-3991)</li>

      <li><b>Cart Columns:</b> Fixed an issue preventing successfully saving Shopping Cart Column configurations. (enterprise-3993)</li>
    <br> 
    <p><b><a href="https://bit.ly/47u5pXD" target="_blak" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0.3028</a>(2024-09-18)</b></p>
    <p><b>Library Enhancements:</b></p>
      <li>We've introduce an update allowing Parts Page BOMs to display without waiting for the Shopping Cart to load, in addition to a toast notification indicating slow load times when applicable. (enterprise-3960)</li>
    <p><b>Admin Enhancements:</b></p>
      <li>A new content upload progress feature has been implemented. Users will now see a progress bar during uploads, and navigation away from the page is prevented until the upload is complete. This improvement ensures that content is saved successfully before allowing users to leave the page. (enterprise-3978)</li>
    <p><b>Item Details - Final Updates before GA!</b></p>
      Item Details Page will be released for General Availability in October! We have made the following recent changes to this beta feature:
          <li>Tabs within the Item Details page have been moved to cards, creating a seamless experience for users to view all information about parts, pages, chapters and media on one page without the need for additional clicks. (enterprise-3966)</li>
          <li>The Item Details page has been updated for better mobile experience. On devices with screen widths of 640 pixels or less, the title is now hidden for most content types, except for Page Widgets where it remains visible. (enterprise-3954)</li>
          <li>We've improved the handling of long content names in the Item Details page. The interface now better accommodates lengthy titles, preventing overlap with action buttons and improving overall readability. (enterprise-3876)</li>
          <li>The Info and Back buttons on the Item Details page have been redesigned for improved user discovery. The Info button now includes "More Info" text, and the Back button has been updated to "Return to Viewer" with a new color scheme. (enterprise-3870)</li>
          <li>The Info button for chapters, and media is now disabled when there is no additional information available. This helps users quickly identify which items have extra details to review. (enterprise-3782)</li>
          <li>The Library now opens the new Item Details Page for a part when selecting a part from any location throughout the Library. (enterprise-3800)</li>

    <p><b>Widgets Enhancements:</b></p>
      <li>We've added the Home button previously seen in the Library to the Library Widget, providing users with a consistent search experience across different search bars. (enterprise-3974)</li>
    <p><b>Bug Fixes:</b></p>
      <li>We've implemented a change to attempt to address issues where orders are submitted with quantities equivalent to those of zip codes found on the order for.  This change prevents users from autofilling quantity fields with zip codes stored in their browser. (enterprise-3643)</li>
      <li>We've resolved an issue where hotpoints were not displaying when opening a book from part search results. Users should now see hotpoints correctly without needing to refresh the page. (enterprise-4024)</li>

      <li>A bug where the tenant default search setting was not being honored has been fixed. The library will now correctly use the 'Exact' search setting when configured at the tenant level. (enterprise-3987)</li>
    <br>
    <p><b><a href="https://bit.ly/4cHxITg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0.2959</a> (2024-08-21)</b></p>
    <p><b>Library Enhancements:</b></p>
	    <li><b>New Home Button:</b> A prominent, intuitive and consistently visible “Home” button has been added to the header, allowing users to easily return to the Library Home Page from any location within the application. This new feature also clears the Documoto search bar when clicked, ensuring a fresh start for new searches.</li>
	    <li><b>Library Search Bar Context:</b> The general, book and page search bars in the Documoto library will now give users more context in regard to what they are searching against. Users will now see “Search all content…” in the library search bar, “Search in [Book Name]…” in the book search bar and “Search in [Page Name]…” in the BOM search bar. These changes were made to provide a more intuitive indication of the search scope. Existing tenant labels for the Library general search bar will continue to be honored.</li>
      <li><b>Search Term Retention:</b> The library search now retains the last search term until the user clears it. This gives users more control over when the search term is cleared and provides better context as they navigate content.</li>
      <li><b>Ability to Hide Banner Image on Library Homepage:</b> A new option to hide the banner on the main page of the library has been added to provide a better experience for end users. Administrative users can now access this feature in the Admin Center under Library Settings, where they can toggle the “Disable Library Banner Image” option. This change applies to both the Library Widget and Library App.</li>
      <li><b>Automatic Hiding of Banner Image on Tablet Screen Resolutions:</b> When a Library user is on a device with a screen resolution with a less than 1024 pixel width, they will no longer see the banner image on the library home page. This change was introduced to improve the browsing experience on smaller device screen sizes, where real-estate for content viewing is limited.</li>
      <li><b>New Lightbox Viewer for 2D Thumbnails Released for General Availability:</b> The 2D thumbnail lightbox viewer in the Library has been enhanced with panning functionality. Users can now use mouse or touch controls to drag the image up, down, left, and right when zoomed in. This feature will be released for all Library App users, and will be accessible from the Part Info page</li>
      <li><b>PDF Viewer Updates:</b> We have upgraded our PDF Viewer. The new version includes various improvements and bug fixes, enhancing the overall PDF viewing experience in the Library.</li>
    <p><b>Library Bug Fixes:</b></p>
      <li><b>PDF Text-Selection Issues:</b> Text selection in PDF documents has been restored, allowing users to select individual part numbers within text-selectable PDFs in the Documoto Library. Previously, users could only select entire columns in BOM tables. This fix enhances the usability of PDF documents by enabling more precise text selection. (enterprise-3165)</li>
      <li><b>PDF Destination Hyperlinks Retention:</b> PDF hyperlinks where the destination is within the PDF document are now retained when printing books to PDF via Export Jobs. Previously, when printing a book containing PDF pages, the hyperlinks would disappear and become inactive in the printed document. This fix ensures that document links remain preserved and functional in the printed output. If Documoto cannot recalculate the correct page to successfully target, they will be removed upon export. (enterprise-3172)</li>
      <li><b>Item Details Page Search Navigation Issue:</b> The issue of incorrect item details pages opening when accessing parts through book search has been resolved. Users will now be directed to the correct part item details page when clicking on a part in the book search results. This eliminates the problem of being redirected to  page item details instead of the intended part item details. (enterprise-3935)</li>
      <li><b>Back Button Fix for Paginated Search Results:</b> The back button functionality has been fixed to return users to the correct paginated page in search results. When navigating back from a piece of content, users will now be brought to the original page of search results where the content was found, instead of defaulting to the first page. This fix also introduced more reliability of search results when navigating between different paginated search result pages. This improvement applies to both Documoto Library and Documoto Widgets. (enterprise-3840)</li>
    <p><b>Admin Center Bug Fixes:</b></p>
	<li><b>Widget Key Domain Field Fix:</b> The domain validation for widget keys has been fixed to accept valid domains ending with 7-character values. Previously, there were issues with setting valid domains for new widget keys, particularly those ending in longer strings. The updated TLD validation criteria now correctly handles a wider range of valid domain formats. (enterprise-3914)</li>

    <p><b>Library updates:</b></p>
      <li><b>Default Thumbnail Fix:</b> Documoto Library was inconsistently showing default thumbnails on the “Info” page. This has been corrected and now system default thumbnails and part default override thumbnails will always show on the info page when a custom thumbnail has not been set.</li>

      <li>Addressed an issue where tag prefixes passed via a Search Direct URL were not honored, resulting in incorrect search results. (enterprise-3846)</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue where enabling Dynamic Naming on Parts and Pages caused Where Used to open incorrect content. (enterprise-3362)</li>
      <li>Corrected an issue where opening a page or book from the Part Details > Where Used page did not apply the correct exact-match search in the TOC. (enterprise-3847)</li>

  <p><b>Library Beta Features:</b></p>
  <li><b>Item Details BETA Feature - Mobile Enhancements:</b> The content viewer browsing experience in the beta Item Details page has been improved on smaller screen sizes by replacing the text-based tabs with drawers that can be expanded and collapsed.

    <li><b>Related Static Media:</b> Clicking on the name of a related static media (image, document, video) now redirects the user to the media within Documoto, without opening a new tab in the browser (enterprise-3803)</li>
  <li><b>Thumbnail Preview on top Rows is Partially Hidden:</b> An issue where part thumbnail previews were partially hidden near the top of a BOM has been resolved (enterprise-3789)</li>
